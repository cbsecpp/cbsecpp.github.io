title: Downloading Turbo C++ For Windows
---

CBSE students must only follow the old Turbo C++ standard and it can be really tricky to download this very old IDE. Most of the installation files on the internet doesn't seems to be working or you'll end up having to view pages littered with ads and needs you to register to download the file. To avoid all these problems, I've myself collected the installation files for both the Windows version and DOS version and put up on a clutter free website. I'll share the link with you.
Link for downloading the DOS Version : https://mega.nz/#!N4ByURxZ!fRzvqBLXCEkO5O1cgy0zzWn15oT8BzvEhfHQaACBWos
Link for downloading the Windows Version : https://mega.nz/#!5sYHlLzK!xPHdDdlK4iyCLpRnjcGYfahFBEQkuJo7i4C8g3gozy4

Thank you and I hope it was helpful for you.
